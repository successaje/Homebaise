# Pinata Setup Guide

## Overview

Pinata is used for IPFS file storage in the Homebaise platform. This guide will help you set up Pinata for the property listing feature.

## Step 1: Create Pinata Account

1. Go to [https://app.pinata.cloud/](https://app.pinata.cloud/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

## Step 2: Get Your API Keys

1. Log in to your Pinata dashboard
2. Go to **API Keys** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Key**
4. Give your key a name (e.g., "Homebaise Property Uploads")
5. Select the following permissions:
   - **Pin File to IPFS** ‚úÖ
   - **Pin JSON to IPFS** ‚úÖ
   - **Pin By Hash** ‚úÖ
   - **Pin List** ‚úÖ
6. Click **Create**
7. Copy your **JWT Token** (you'll only see it once!)

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root (if it doesn't exist)
2. Add your Pinata JWT token:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT_TOKEN=your_jwt_token_here
```

3. Restart your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Step 4: Test the Integration

1. Go to your property listing page (`/list-property`)
2. Try uploading a test image
3. Check the browser console for any errors
4. Verify the file appears in your Pinata dashboard

## Features

### ‚úÖ What Pinata Provides

- **File Upload**: Direct upload to IPFS
- **File Pinning**: Ensures files stay available
- **Gateway Access**: Files accessible via `https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/{cid}`
- **Metadata Storage**: JSON metadata storage
- **File Management**: View and manage uploaded files

### üìÅ File Types Supported

- **Images**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP (up to 10MB each)
- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX (up to 20MB each)
- **Metadata**: JSON files for property information

### üîß API Endpoints Used

- `POST /pinning/pinFileToIPFS` - Upload files
- `POST /pinning/pinByHash` - Pin existing files
- `GET /pinning/pinList` - List pinned files
- `GET /data/testAuthentication` - Test connection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Pinata upload failed"**
   - Check your JWT token is correct
   - Verify the token has the right permissions
   - Ensure your Pinata account is active

2. **"CORS error"**
   - This shouldn't happen with Pinata's API
   - Check your network connection
   - Try refreshing the page

3. **"File too large"**
   - Pinata free tier has limits
   - Consider upgrading or compressing files
   - Check file size before upload

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=true
```

This will show detailed upload information in the console.

## Free Tier Limits

- **Storage**: 1GB
- **File Size**: Up to 100MB per file
- **Requests**: 100 requests per day
- **Bandwidth**: 1GB per month

For production use, consider upgrading to a paid plan.

## Security Notes

- Keep your JWT token secure
- Don't commit `.env.local` to version control
- Use environment-specific tokens for dev/staging/prod
- Monitor your Pinata usage regularly
