# Property Token Purchase Flow - Quick Reference

## Overview
This document provides a quick reference for understanding how property token purchases work in the Homebaise platform.

---

## High-Level Flow

```
User clicks "Invest" 
  ↓
Payment processed (PaymentProcessor)
  ↓
InvestmentService.executeInvestment()
  ↓
InvestmentFlow.executeInvestment()
  ↓
1. Fetch property & treasury
2. Validate investment
3. Calculate tokens (1:1 ratio)
4. Check token availability
5. Get investor info (including private key)
6. Create pending investment record
7. Execute Hedera token transfer:
   a. Associate token with investor account ✅
   b. Transfer tokens from treasury
8. Update investment as completed
9. Update treasury balance
  ↓
Success! Investor receives tokens
```

## Key Components

### Frontend: `src/app/properties/[id]/invest/page.tsx`

```typescript
// When user confirms payment
const handlePaymentSuccess = async (transactionId: string) => {
  const result = await InvestmentService.executeInvestment(
    property.id,
    user.id,
    form.amount
  );
  
  if (result.success) {
    // Show confirmation
    setShowConfirmation(true);
  }
};
```

### Service Layer: `src/lib/investment.ts`

```typescript
// Simple wrapper
static async executeInvestment(
  propertyId: string,
  investorId: string,
  amount: number
): Promise<InvestmentFlowResult> {
  return await executePropertyInvestment(propertyId, investorId, amount);
}
```

### Core Logic: `src/lib/investment-flow.ts`

```typescript
class InvestmentFlow {
  async executeInvestment(
    propertyId: string,
    investorId: string,
    investmentAmount: number
  ): Promise<InvestmentFlowResult> {
    // Fetch data
    const { property, treasuryInfo } = await this.fetchPropertyAndTreasury(propertyId);
    const investorInfo = await this.fetchInvestorInfo(investorId);
    
    // Validate
    const validation = this.validateInvestment(property, treasuryInfo, investmentAmount);
    if (!validation.valid) return { success: false, error: validation.error };
    
    // Create pending record
    const investment = await supabase.from('investments').insert(...);
    
    // Execute Hedera transfer (NOW WITH TOKEN ASSOCIATION!)
    const transactionHash = await this.transferTokens(
      treasuryInfo.hedera_account_id,
      treasuryInfo.hedera_private_key,
      investorInfo.hedera_account_id,
      investorInfo.hedera_private_key,  // ✅ Key addition
      treasuryInfo.token_id,
      tokensToPurchase
    );
    
    // Update as completed
    await supabase.from('investments').update({ status: 'completed', ... });
    
    return { success: true, investment, transactionHash };
  }
}
```

### Hedera Integration: Token Transfer with Association

```typescript
private async transferTokens(
  fromAccountId: string,
  fromPrivateKey: string,
  toAccountId: string,
  toPrivateKey: string,     // ✅ Added parameter
  tokenId: string,
  amount: number
): Promise<string> {
  // STEP 1: Ensure token association ✅
  try {
    const associateTx = await new TokenAssociateTransaction()
      .setAccountId(toAccount)
      .setTokenIds([token])
      .freezeWith(this.client)
      .sign(toKey);
    
    await associateTx.execute(this.client);
  } catch (error) {
    // Ignore if already associated
    if (!/already associated/i.test(error)) throw error;
  }
  
  // STEP 2: Transfer tokens
  const transferTx = new TransferTransaction()
    .addTokenTransfer(token, fromAccount, -amount)
    .addTokenTransfer(token, toAccount, amount)
    .setMaxTransactionFee(new Hbar(5));
  
  const frozenTx = await transferTx.freezeWith(this.client);  // ✅ Freeze
  const signedTx = await frozenTx.sign(fromKey);              // ✅ Sign
  const response = await signedTx.execute(this.client);       // ✅ Execute
  
  return response.transactionId.toString();
}
```

## Database Tables Involved

### 1. `investments`
- Records each token purchase
- Status: pending → completed/failed
- Stores transaction hash

### 2. `property_treasury_accounts`
- Stores treasury Hedera account credentials
- Tracks token balance
- Updated after each purchase

### 3. `profiles`
- Stores investor's Hedera account credentials
- Required fields:
  - `hedera_account_id`: e.g., "0.0.1234567"
  - `hedera_private_key`: encrypted private key

### 4. `properties`
- Property details
- Min/max investment amounts
- Status (active/tokenized)

---

## Required Environment Variables

```env
# Hedera Network Configuration
MY_ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.xxxxxxx              # Operator account ID
MY_PRIVATE_KEY=302e...                 # Operator private key
NEXT_PUBLIC_HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet     # Network (testnet/mainnet)

# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...
```

---

## Token Association Explained

### Why is it needed?
On Hedera, accounts have an "opt-in" model for tokens. Before an account can receive a specific token, it must explicitly associate with that token. This is a security feature to prevent spam tokens.

### When does it happen?
- Automatically on first token purchase
- Takes 2-5 seconds
- Costs ~$0.05 USD
- Only needed once per token per account

### What if already associated?
The code handles this gracefully:
```typescript
if (!/already associated/i.test(error)) throw error;
```
If the token is already associated, the error is ignored and the flow continues with the transfer.

## Error Handling

### Investment Flow Errors

| Step | Possible Error | Handling |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Fetch Property | Property not found | Return error, no DB changes |
| Validation | Invalid amount | Return error, no DB changes |
| Create Record | DB error | Return error |
| Token Association | Network failure | Mark investment as failed |
| Token Transfer | Insufficient balance | Mark investment as failed |
| Update Status | DB error | Log warning, transaction succeeded |

### Transaction States

```
pending ──────┬─→ completed (successful transfer)
              └─→ failed (error during transfer)
```

---

## Monitoring & Verification

### Verify Successful Purchase

1. **Database Check:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM investments 
WHERE investor_id = 'user-uuid' 
  AND status = 'completed';
```

2. **Hedera Check:**
Visit HashScan: `https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/{transactionId}`

3. **Token Balance Check:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(tokens_purchased) as total_tokens
FROM investments 
WHERE investor_id = 'user-uuid' 
  AND property_id = 'property-uuid'
  AND status = 'completed';
```

## Testing Checklist

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Test property created and tokenized
- [ ] Test investor has Hedera account (hedera_account_id + hedera_private_key in profiles)
- [ ] Test investor has completed KYC
- [ ] Treasury has sufficient token balance
- [ ] Environment variables configured

### Test Cases
- [ ] First-time purchase (triggers token association)
- [ ] Second purchase (token already associated)
- [ ] Purchase with insufficient treasury balance
- [ ] Purchase below minimum investment
- [ ] Purchase above maximum investment
- [ ] Network interruption during association
- [ ] Network interruption during transfer

### Expected Results
- [ ] Investment record created with status 'pending'
- [ ] Token association succeeds (or detects existing association)
- [ ] Token transfer succeeds
- [ ] Investment status updated to 'completed'
- [ ] Transaction ID stored in investment record
- [ ] Treasury balance decremented
- [ ] Transaction visible on HashScan
- [ ] Investor can see tokens in their account

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Investor does not have a Hedera account set up"
**Solution:** Ensure `hedera_account_id` and `hedera_private_key` exist in profiles table for the investor.

### Issue: "TOKEN_NOT_ASSOCIATED_TO_ACCOUNT"
**Solution:** This should not happen anymore with the fix. If it does, verify:
- Investor's private key is correct
- Token association transaction is executing
- No network interruption between association and transfer

### Issue: "INSUFFICIENT_TOKEN_BALANCE"
**Solution:** Check treasury account balance. Verify `token_balance` in `property_treasury_accounts` is accurate.

### Issue: "INVALID_SIGNATURE"
**Solution:** Verify correct private keys are stored in database:
- Treasury private key for property
- Investor private key for user

## API Endpoints

### Execute Investment
```http
POST /api/investments/execute
Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "property_id": "uuid",
  "amount": 1000
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "investment": { ... },
  "transactionHash": "0.0.xxxxx@1234567890.123456789"
}
```

---

## Security Notes

### Private Key Storage
- Treasury private keys stored encrypted in database
- Investor private keys stored encrypted in profiles
- Keys retrieved only during transactions
- Keys never logged or exposed in responses

### Transaction Security
- All transactions signed with appropriate keys
- Receipts verified before marking as completed
- Failed transactions rolled back in database
- Transaction IDs stored for audit trail

## Performance Metrics

| Operation | Time | Cost (HBAR) | Cost (USD) |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------|
| Token Association (first time) | 2-5 sec | ~0.5 | ~$0.05 |
| Token Transfer | 2-5 sec | ~0.001 | ~$0.0001 |
| Total First Purchase | 5-10 sec | ~0.5 | ~$0.05 |
| Subsequent Purchases | 2-5 sec | ~0.001 | ~$0.0001 |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Run through complete flow on testnet
2. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for failed investments
3. **Analytics**: Track association vs transfer timing
4. **Optimization**: Consider batch token association for new users
5. **Documentation**: Update API documentation with new flow
