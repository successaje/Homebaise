# Homebaise

> **Tagline:** “Own, invest, and build trust in Africa — one block at a time.”

**🏆 Hackathon Track:** Onchain Finance & Real-World Assets (RWA)

---

## 🚩 Problem
Millions of Nigerians & Africans struggle with land fraud, missing property records, and lack of access to safe investments.

- Diaspora remittances ($53B into Africa yearly) mostly go into consumption, not wealth-building assets.
- Farmers and property owners can’t unlock liquidity from their assets.

---

## 💡 Solution (Homebaise)
A Hedera-powered RWA platform that:
- Tokenizes land, property & farms into secure digital shares.
- Enables fractional ownership & investment — start with as little as $10.
- Connects diaspora remittances directly into real assets back home.
- Provides yield & liquidity through property rentals or crop revenue sharing.

---

## 🔑 Features
- 📜 **Onchain Land Registry:** Transparent, tamper-proof, fraud-proof
- 🌍 **Diaspora Gateway:** Send remittances as investments, not just cash
- 💸 **Micro-Investments:** Buy fractions of real estate or farmland
- 🌱 **Farmer Financing:** Tokenized crops & collateral-based loans
- 🔒 **Trust Layer:** Hedera's DLT ensures fairness, speed & low costs

---

## 🚀 Planned Features: Property Token Collateralization

### Using Homebaise Property Tokens as Collateral

Once properties are tokenized via the Hedera Token Service (HTS), each token represents a verified, on-chain share of real estate value. That means those tokens can serve as backed digital assets and be used as collateral for loans or credit within the ecosystem.

### 💡 Possible Implementations

**DeFi Collateralization Layer**
- Integrate with lending protocols (like Aave or HBAR-native protocols such as SaucerSwap or Heliswap extensions)
- Users can stake their property tokens (e.g., ZOVT) as collateral
- They receive stablecoins, HBAR, or Homebaise credits in return — all managed via smart contracts

**Peer-to-Peer Lending (P2P)**
- Token holders can offer their tokens as collateral for community-driven loans
- The loan agreement is recorded on Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) for transparency
- If repayment fails, the tokenized property shares are automatically transferred to the lender

**Real Estate Credit Scores (AI + Onchain)**
- Homebaise AI can assess risk and yield potential of collateralized assets
- Users with a strong investment track record and verified identity get better credit terms
- This creates a trustless property credit market

**Stablecoin-Backed Loans**
- Borrow against your property tokens in stable assets (e.g., USDC, HUSD, or future Homebaise-stable)
- Useful for developers or investors who want liquidity without selling their property shares

### 🌟 Why It's a Big Deal

- **Unlocks liquidity** from traditionally illiquid real estate assets
- **Bridges DeFi + Real Estate**, enabling real yield backed by real assets
- **Empowers African investors** to access credit using verifiable, tokenized property holdings — not just fiat collateral
- **Creates a sustainable DeFi loop** around property ownership, income, and lending

### 🔮 Impact on Web3 & Hedera

This feature positions Homebaise as a bridge between traditional real estate and decentralized finance, showcasing how **Real-World Assets (RWA)** can unlock new financial primitives on Hedera:

- **Demonstrates RWA utility beyond simple tokenization** — tokens become functional financial instruments
- **Showcases Hedera's capabilities** for DeFi use cases with predictable fees and fast finality
- **Creates network effects** — more property tokens = more collateral = more liquidity in the ecosystem
- **Opens new revenue streams** for token holders without selling their property shares
- **Sets a precedent** for other RWA projects on Hedera to follow

---

## 🌍 Impact
- Nigerians/Africans get trustworthy land ownership & accessible investments.
- Diaspora Africans build generational wealth, not just spend.
- Farmers gain capital & fairer markets.
- Hedera becomes the backbone of African real-world assets.
