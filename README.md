# Homebaise

> **Tagline:** “Own, invest, and build trust in Africa — one block at a time.”

---

## 🚩 Problem
Millions of Nigerians & Africans struggle with land fraud, missing property records, and lack of access to safe investments.

- Diaspora remittances ($53B into Africa yearly) mostly go into consumption, not wealth-building assets.
- Farmers and property owners can’t unlock liquidity from their assets.

---

## 💡 Solution (Homebaise)
A Hedera-powered RWA platform that:
- Tokenizes land, property & farms into secure digital shares.
- Enables fractional ownership & investment — start with as little as $10.
- Connects diaspora remittances directly into real assets back home.
- Provides yield & liquidity through property rentals or crop revenue sharing.

---

## 🔑 Features
- 📜 **Onchain Land Registry:** Transparent, tamper-proof, fraud-proof
- 🌍 **Diaspora Gateway:** Send remittances as investments, not just cash
- 💸 **Micro-Investments:** Buy fractions of real estate or farmland
- 🌱 **Farmer Financing:** Tokenized crops & collateral-based loans
- 🔒 **Trust Layer:** Hedera’s DLT ensures fairness, speed & low costs

---

## 🌍 Impact
- Nigerians get trustworthy land ownership & accessible investments.
- Diaspora Africans build generational wealth, not just spend.
- Farmers gain capital & fairer markets.
- Hedera becomes the backbone of African real-world assets.
