## 🚩 Problem
Millions of Nigerians & Africans struggle with land fraud, missing property records, and lack of access to safe investments.

- Diaspora remittances ($53B into Africa yearly) mostly go into consumption, not wealth-building assets.
- Farmers and property owners can’t unlock liquidity from their assets.

---

## 💡 Solution (Homebaise)
A Hedera-powered RWA platform that:
- Tokenizes land, property & farms into secure digital shares.
- Enables fractional ownership & investment — start with as little as $10.
- Connects diaspora remittances directly into real assets back home.
- Provides yield & liquidity through property rentals or crop revenue sharing.
