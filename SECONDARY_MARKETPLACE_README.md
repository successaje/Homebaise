## 🎯 Use Cases

### For Property Owners
**"I tokenized my $1M property into 10,000 tokens. Now investors can buy as little as 1 token ($100) and trade them instantly on the marketplace."**

### For Investors
**"I bought tokens 3 months ago at $45. Now they're trading at $52. I can sell instantly without waiting months for a buyer."**

### For Traders
**"I provide liquidity by placing both buy and sell orders. I earn from the spread and help create efficient markets."**

### For the Platform
**"Every trade generates 0.5% fee revenue. With $10M monthly volume, that's $50K/month passive income."**
