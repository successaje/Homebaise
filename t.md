In Africa today, over 1.4 billion people live on the world’s most resource-rich continent —  
yet less than 2% have access to modern real estate investment opportunities.  

Property ownership remains a dream for many — locked behind bureaucracy, middlemen, and billion-dollar corporations.  

But what if we could change that?  


Introducing Homebaise — the first AI-powered real estate tokenization, investment, and trading platform built on the Hedera Network.  

Homebaise is redefining property ownership — turning real-world assets into digital, tradable tokens,  
so anyone, anywhere, can own a share of real estate starting from just a few HBAR.  


With Hedera Token Service, Homebaise fractionalizes verified properties into fungible tokens —  
giving everyday people from Lagos to Nairobi the power to invest in homes, lands, and developments with ease.  

And with Hedera Consensus Service, every transaction, update, and yield report is recorded immutably and transparently,  
eliminating fraud and ensuring full trust on-chain.  

 
But we’re not stopping there.  

Homebaise AI helps users discover high-performing properties, predict yields, and make smarter investment decisions —  
all directly through WhatsApp or Telegram.  
No apps. No jargon.  
Just simple messages, insights, and ownership — in one tap.  


And for traders — we’ve built Homebaise Markets.  
A next-generation, onchain marketplace where tokenized real estate trades just like crypto.  

Fast. Liquid. Global.  

Verified real estate assets are fractionalized and tradable, giving investors and traders freedom to buy, sell, and earn — instantly.  
Backed by real value, not speculation.  

Every trade, every market movement, every record — secured through HCS for full transparency and verifiable history.  
It’s DeFi meets Real World Assets — the new frontier of tokenized finance.  


Homebaise AI keeps traders informed —  
analyzing market signals, sentiment, and portfolio performance, then delivering personalized insights, alerts, and trading recommendations  
straight to your phone.  
No dashboards. No learning curve.  
Just trade, track, and win — right from your chats.  


Africa’s real estate market is projected to hit $1.5 trillion by 2030,  
yet millions of young Africans are locked out of owning or investing in property.  

Homebaise changes that —  For the first time, Africans can trade pieces of the continent’s $1.5 trillion real estate market, turning every property into an opportunity, every user into an owner,  
and every transaction into progress.  

Built for Africa. Powered by Hedera.  
Driven by AI.  

Homebaise — Own. Trade. Evolve. 
Own a Piece of Tomorrow.
